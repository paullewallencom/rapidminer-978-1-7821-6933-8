Overview

RapidMiner processes and files are contained in folders corresponding to the chapters of the book. 
The files are intended to be used to help explain the concepts within the book and are not intended to be used in production environments. 
No support will be given for them.

Load the processes from the RapidMiner Studio GUI by doing File->Import Process. 
It is sensible to save the processes in a RapidMiner repository by doing File->Save Process As.

Some of the processes read and write data from a folder. 
This is c:\exploringDataWithRapidMiner on Windows but this can be changed if needed. Don't forget to change the processes that refer to them.
Linux and Mac users will definately need to do some changes.

To help get started, this folder and the relevant files are provided for you and these can be copied directly.
